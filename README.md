# User Research at the City of Austin

This guide provides the processes and standards for involving residents in our work through user and design research. The guide focuses on recruiting and coordinating residents with user research.

### This guide is for you if...

* you have a product that is in early development, but it has never been tested with real users.&#x20;
* you have a product that youâ€™re about to pilot or launch, but it has never been tested with real users.
* you have a product that has already launched, but your users are not using it or do not like using it.&#x20;

This guide is intended to be shared and used by City of Austin staff and anyone who can benefit from it. We are also, always looking to improve our strategies and methods. \
