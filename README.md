# User Research at the City of Austin

In this guide we walk you through the processes and standards that we have established for involving residents in our work through user and design research. This guide has a focus on recruiting and coordinating user research with residents.

This guide is intended to be shared and used by anyone who can benefit from it. We are also, always looking to improve our strategies and methods.
