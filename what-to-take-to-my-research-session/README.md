# Preparing for Your Research Session

## What to do before a research session

#### Practice your test or research questions.

Taking the time to run through your questions before using them will help you catch questions or tasks that are confusing.

#### Make sure your technology is charged and up to date.

#### Print your packet.

Be sure to bring one packet per research session. Include the following in your packet:

* Moderators script or research protocol
* Gift Card Agreement (2 copies)

#### Connect to the WIFI and test the connection.

Make sure set up on WIFI well before our research session if testing a website or prototype.
