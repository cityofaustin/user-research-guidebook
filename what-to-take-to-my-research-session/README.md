# Preparing for your research session

## What to do before a research session

#### Practice your test or research questions.

Taking the time to run through your test before you take will help you catch questions or tasks that are confusing and

#### Make sure your technology is charged and up to date.

#### Print your packet.

Be sure to bring one packet per research session. In that packet be sure to include:

* Moderators script or research protocol
* Gift Card Agreement (2 copies)

#### Connect to the wifi and test it out.

If your testing a website or prototype, make sure set up on wifi well before our research session.
