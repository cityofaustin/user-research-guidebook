# Post Research Follow-up & Evangalism

Keeping the lines of communication open after a research session is a good idea. Quite often participants remember something really important to them after they have left the research session. We want to be sure they can easily communicate that to us.

Another purpose of the post research email is to ask them to recruit for us. Participants are likely to tell other people about good experiences during research participation. This email gives them the permission to do that and provides them with a link to our general screener.
