# Compensation Guidelines

### **Why incentives are important**

In order to ensure inclusive and equitable research it is crucial to provide and incentive and compensate test participants for their time. Some people might have to take time off work or go out of their way to test your prototype. Without these incentives, we are excluding a portion of our population that will provide valuable data. An incentive is a necessary action to thank them for their time and this ensures you get an equitable pool of participants, not just people who are retired \(though they are great demographics to reach as well\) and have free time to chat with you. Providing an incentive is also helpful if you are asking for a large effort of them for your test or if you have follow-up test sessions.  ****

### **Guidelines for compensation**

* Gift cards are not allowed to be general / same as cash. They must be for specific businesses. \(HEB/coffee shop/amazon/bus passes/other transport\)
* Research/Usability test plan must be created and include defined demographic targets and plans for reaching the desired participants.
  * Equitable and inclusive research plans are required prior to release of funds
  * Gift cards should be provided at the time of interview to avoid problems with coordinating delivery and ensuring participants feel valued
* Find the Gift card procurement process in the [ODD field guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11w8I9X3hpg1GM_nCvKlMj6U4F4tM1yDdULUPc_e7RwY/edit?usp=sharing).
* Request approval for budget usage to Gerald Oliver who will coordinate with Marni Wilhite
* Consider the most beneficial environment for the research. Does it need to be contextual \(actions they mostly take at home or at work\) or can it be in a public library or other setting that meets them where they are?
  * Scheduling in home, in their office, or other contextual space should provide higher compensation levels due to the fact that they will be preparing for us. Itâ€™s not just during the time of the interview that they will be using their time.
  * Scheduling where they would have to travel to us also compensates at a higher rate due to travel time for the participant.
