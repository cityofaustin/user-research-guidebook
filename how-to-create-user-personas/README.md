# Create User Personas

After initial user research, consider creating Personas. Personas are depictions of your different types of users, that describe who they are, their needs, and their motivations. They serve as a guiding light for developing tools and services. There can be multiple user types, or personas, for each service that your department provides.

Developing user personas is an important step to making sure your users’ needs are met when they come to your site. However, developing personas requires a large amount of research and resources, which is not always easily accessible to departments.

If you are not able to dedicate resources to developing personas in depth, there are still ways you can put yourself in your users’ shoes in order to make sure they get what they need from your website.
