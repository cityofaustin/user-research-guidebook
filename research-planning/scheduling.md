  is important to have a process that works for everyone. This page outlines our

# Scheduling for researchers

#### Step 1

Before scheduling research sessions with participants be sure you have a clear understanding of the timeframe and requirements of the research. This is usually documented in a [Recruitment & Screening Document](../recruiting/recruitment-process-and-timeline.md).

#### Step 2

Sync up with all the people who should be at a research sessions and see when they have availability for research. I like to make sure that there are a variety of times available. Some early in the day, some mid-day and some in the afternoon or evening. Usually holding times for research looks like:

* Tuesday, June 12th from 8:00am to 1:00pm
* Wednesday, June 13th from 11:00am to 4:00pm
* Friday, June 15th from 3:00pm to 6:30pm

#### Step 3

When the research time availability is determined, be sure to hold that time on everyone's calendar. This prevents them from scheduling meetings or events during the times that you will offer participants.

#### Step 4

Offer those times to all the participants who responded with interest. See how we offer these times to residents by looking at our [Scheduling Research Session](../research-ethics-and-etiquette-draft/communicating-with-participate-draft/scheduling-research-session.md) communication template.

#### Step 5

When participants accept a research session time, create a calendar invite for all the researchers involved in the session. Be sure to include the participants name, the location of the session, any notes they might need.

#### Step 6

When all the research is scheduled, clear the holds off the researchers calendars.
