# Public Information Policy

### What is it & why should I use it?&#x20;

The Texas Public Information Act gives the public the right to access government records, and the public information officer may not ask why they want them. All government information is presumed to be available to the public, with certain exceptions.

### How do I use it?&#x20;

Keep in mind that everything we create and document becomes part of public records. That includes but not limited to any photo or video we take of research participants, any notes about their feedback, or any other documentation may be subject to a Public Information Request.
