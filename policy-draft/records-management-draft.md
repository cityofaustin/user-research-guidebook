# Records Management

## What is it & why should I use it?

&#x20;“Records management” refers to how we take care of all the documents we create here at the city, in the course of doing our work. Please review the City Clerk's Office intranet site on [Records and Information Management Overview](https://cityofaustin.sharepoint.com/sites/RIM/SitePages/RIM-Overview.aspx) for guidance on what to keep and how to store it. Your department should have a designated Records Manager who can provide you guidance as well.&#x20;
