# Usability Testing

### **What is it**

Identify usability problems that need to be addressed. Usability can refer to many things - is it easy to use, is it logical, does it makes sense, can people find what they need to complete the task they want to complete, and many more. Think Aloud is often a method used during usability testing.

### Why Should I use it

* People who have dedicated time to test your idea.&#x20;
* Real time observation and narration of how the person is perceiving your prototype.&#x20;
* Ability to ask follow-up questions.
* &#x20;Good for prototypes that are more refined and have real content or features for testing.

### **Length of time per test**

* 30 - 60 mins
