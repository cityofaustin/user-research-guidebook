# Research etiquette(DRAFT)

## Keep an open mind

* Come in with fresh eyes - even if you’ve been working in this field or have worked on this idea for a long time, treat every test as a brand new learning opportunity, you might notice things that you didn’t before.&#x20;
* Do not bring along your personal biases - leave your assumptions and biases behind so you have an unfiltered mind to take in new information instead of automatically rejecting the information to disregarding it.

## Designate Roles before&#x20;

## Be curious, listen to the participants

* Awkward silences are ok - most participants need time to process and think before answering.&#x20;
* Avoid interrupting or finishing their sentences - don’t assume you know what they’re going to say, even if you’re right, you want to hear it from their own words.&#x20;
* Do not contradict or correct them, even if they are “wrong” - we are here to learn about how they experience your prototype.&#x20;
* Ask open ended questions - don’t ask leading questions that might sway their answer or make them feel like they have to validate your prototype or opinion.&#x20;
* You might have the urge to over explain your concept, teach them how to use it, or try to convince them that your concept is valuable. That will not lead to accurate test results. Refrain from leading them on or swaying their perspective. Just give them enough context so they know what they’re looking at and step back to see how they interact with your idea.&#x20;
* Ask followup questions, ask them to elaborate or “tell me more about that.”

## Always document

* Take notes verbatim, as much direct quotes as possible - we will synthesize later
* Take as many photos/audio/video as you can - you should ask for permission in the beginning

## What to bring&#x20;

* Notebook
* Pen&#x20;
* Prototype&#x20;
* Test plan&#x20;
* Camera
* Audio recorder
* Video camera

## What to wear&#x20;

* Wear your badge on your collar or shirt so it is visible&#x20;
* Business card (if you have one)&#x20;
* Dress casual - No Suits ( this helps the particpate feel comfortable and not feel like they are being interviewed.)
