# Interviews

### Structured Interviews&#x20;

A set of questions prepared in advance. The interviewer uses only the list of predetermined questions and in particular order. Sometimes structured interviews may even provide options for the respondent to choose from. Thus, structured interviews can be classified as both qualitative and quantitative research methods.

### Unstructured Interviews&#x20;

The interviewer will have one or several topics to discuss and will lead an informal conversation about them. The questions will depend on the respondentâ€™s thoughts.

### Semi-Structured Interviews&#x20;

During semi-structured interviews, the interviewer can also ask extra questions based on previous answers. This deep-dive can lead to an interesting discussion or the respondent elaborating on something that is critical for the interviewer to know.
