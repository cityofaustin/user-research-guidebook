# Fly on the Wall Observations

### **What is it**

Place your prototype in a real world scenario and stand back to observe how people interact, respond, and feel about it.

### Why Should I use it

* Real first impressions and reactions.
* Quick and easy, no recruitment or incentive required.&#x20;
* Good for rough early prototypes or more refined products.

### **How do I use it?**

1. Find a location or stage a scenario in which you would find your idea.
2. Place your prototype in this location/scenario and watch people interact with it. If this is an early prototype, you might need to do some manual puppeteering to make your prototype “function.”
3. Record their attempt with notes, photos, and video, if possible. Document success/failures, emotional reactions, surprising use cases, etc.

### **Length of time per test**

* 5 - 10 mins
