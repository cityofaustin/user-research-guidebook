# Interviews

### Structured interviews

You will need to have set of questions prepared in advance for your interview. As a Researcher you will  use only the list of predetermined questions and in particular order. Sometimes structured interviews may even provide options for the respondent to choose from. Thus, structured interviews can be classified as both qualitative and quantitative research methods.

### Semi-structured interviews

Consist of questions prepared in advance, but not only. During semi-structured interviews, the interviewer can also ask extra questions based on previous answers. This deep-dive can lead to an interesting discussion or the respondent elaborating on something that is critical for the interviewer to know. You can use probing questions to  learn more.&#x20;

### Unstructured interviews

You usually don't have to have questions prepared in advance. Usually, you  will have one or several topics to cover and will lead an informal conversation about them. The questions will depend on the respondentâ€™s thoughts.\
