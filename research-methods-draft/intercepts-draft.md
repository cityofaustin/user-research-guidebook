# Intercepts

### What is it & why should I use it?&#x20;

Share your rough prototype with real people by intercepting strangers on the street, coffeeshop, or parking lot and asking for their feedback.

1. Find a location with high foot traffic.
2. Ask politely if people would be willing to spare a few minutes to give you feedback.
3. Show them your idea and get their reaction.
4. Record their attempt with notes, photos, and video, if possible. Document their feedback, emotional reactions, surprising use cases, etc.

### **What itâ€™s good for**&#x20;

Quick and easy, no recruitment or incentive required. Good for rough early prototypes. Good for an easy test that takes less than 5 mins to complete. Good for gauging initial interest to see if an idea has legs or testing the first stage of a concept.

### **Length of time per test**&#x20;

10 - 15 mins
