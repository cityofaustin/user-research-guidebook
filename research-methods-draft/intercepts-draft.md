# Intercepts

### What is it & why should I use it?&#x20;

Share your rough prototype with real people by intercepting strangers on the street, coffeeshop, or parking lot and asking for their feedback.

### **What itâ€™s good for**&#x20;

Quick and easy, no recruitment or incentive required. Good for rough early prototypes. Good for an easy test that takes less than 5 mins to complete. Good for gauging initial interest to see if an idea has legs or testing the first stage of a concept.

### **Length of time per test**&#x20;

10 - 15 mins
