# Scheduling Research Session

> **Scheduling your Paid User Testing Session with the City of Austin**

> Hi Lauren,

> I am Kristin Taylor, a user researcher at the City of Austin. I am reaching out to you because you recently signed up to help us test the new Office of Police Oversight form.
>
> We would love to schedule a time to test the form with you next week. Please let me know if any of these times work for you. A session can start at any of the following times and lasts about an hour.
>
> * Tuesday, March 26th from 2:00 PM - 4:00 PM
> * Wednesday, March 27th from 10:00 AM - 4:00 PM
> * Thursday, March 28th from 1:30 PM - 4:00 PM
>
> If none of those times work for you, feel free to suggest a time that better fits your schedule.
>
> **You will be compensated for your time in the form of a $20 gift card.**
>
> The meeting location is flexible and we would like to meet somewhere that is more convenient for you. Typically we meet at a public library. Our office is located downtown Austin, and we can meet here if you prefer.
>
> Email or call with any questions.
