  We have prepared consent forms in English and Spanish. It is important to
  bring two copies of the same form to each research session. This way the
  participant leaves the session their own copy.

# Photo/Video/Audio Consent Guide

### **Things to cover with participant:**&#x20;

* This is mainly used for documenting and showing our design & research work&#x20;
* Everything becomes part of public record&#x20;
* Participant can say no to the entire thing or select portions they don’t want documented
* When recruiting, make it clear how you will be recording the participant’s feedback and send the consent form for review ahead of time.&#x20;
* When onsite, have the consent form on hand to sign.
* When sharing findings, if using their likeness (photo or video) in a public presentation, reach out and notify the participant as a courtesy.

#### **Sample Script:**

> _We’d like to document the interview so that we can refer back to it later. Also if you say or show us something really insightful, we want to be able to show this in our internal and public presentations. If we do show anything outside of our project team, we’ll change your name and double check with you to make sure the snippet we’re using feels good to you. Everything we collect is mainly used for our reference, but since we work for the city, everything becomes part of public records and subject to open records request, though we don’t anticipate that happening._

With this information, are you comfortable with video, audio and/or photos?&#x20;

If they say no - scale back the ask: photos only? Audio only? Photos without any identifying features?

&#x20;Also tell them that we can stop recording and go off the record at anytime and start back up when they are ready.
