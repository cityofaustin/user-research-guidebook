# Quantitative Metrics

### What is it & why should I use it?

Quantitative metrics refers to numbers and “hard data.” This is objective data that can be counted, measured, tracked, ranked, or put on a scale.

### How do I use it?&#x20;

1. Determine which type of quantitative measurements will help prove your hypothesis or show if your prototype is successful and how you will collect this data.
2. If possible, collect baseline metrics.&#x20;
3. Measure again after introducing prototype. Compare results to baseline metrics.
