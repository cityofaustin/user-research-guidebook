### What is it & why should I use it?

&#x20;Baseline metrics is a measurement of the current state. It establishes how well the current product or service (or lack thereof) is performing. This is what you compare your test results to in order to determine if your ideas are successful or adding value.

### How do I use it?&#x20;

1. Determine which type of measurements makes sense for your idea. This should be something that you can measure before and after introducing the prototype.&#x20;
2. Conduct baseline measurements prior to introducing any prototypes.
