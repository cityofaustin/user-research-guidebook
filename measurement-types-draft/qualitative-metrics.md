# Qualitative Metrics

### What is it & why should I use it?&#x20;

Qualitative metrics refers to data that is not in numerical form, often referred to as “soft data.” This often comes in the form of stories, quotes, pictures, emotions, and comments.

### How do I use it?&#x20;

Determine which type of qualitative measurements will help prove your hypothesis or show if your prototype is successful and how you will collect this data. If possible, collect baseline metrics. Measure again after introducing prototype. Compare results to baseline metrics.
