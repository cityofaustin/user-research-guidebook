# Post Research Follow-up & Evangalism

Keeping the lines of communication open after a research session is always a good idea. Quite often participants remember something really important to them after they have left the research session and we want to be sure they can easily communicate that to us. 

Another purpose of this email is to ask them to recruit for us. If participants have a good experience participating in research with us, they are likely to tell other people about it. This email gives them the permission to do that and provides them with a link to our general screener.

> Hi Robin,

> Would you like to be part of similar sessions in the future? If so, please kindly [fill out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScEZa1kZM6Agyibq5L3y9JnFsV6hfNOaaSu8hq9FAPUnlmwqQ/viewform?usp=sf_link). If youâ€™ve already filled out the form, thank you.

> Lastly, if you know other Austinites who might be interested in sharing their stories or testing out new tools, please forward the form to them as well! We would also love if you shared it on social media.
