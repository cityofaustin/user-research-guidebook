# What we do and why \(in plain language\) \(DRAFT\)

As an office we are always talking about what we do and why. The way communicate changes depending on who we are talking to. Since a lot of our research effort relies on help from community connectors we always have blurbs about what we are doing and why that we can share. 

We have a [medium post](https://medium.com/civiqueso/help-test-the-city-of-austins-new-website-1d405c660fd4) that clearly outlines why we involve residents in our research and how that generally happens. This is a great article to link out to when doing user research research so that participants and community groups know what we're doing and why.
