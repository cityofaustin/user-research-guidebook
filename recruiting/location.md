  To make it possible for all residents to participate in research, we engage
  with the community near where they live and work and at a time that works with
  their schedule.

# Location (DRAFT)

Conducting user research in our office at times that are convenient to us is always easier on our end. But there are residents who would not be able to be involved in research if we limited it to our office and during regular working hours. When scheduling research session with residents, we always offer to meet them where they are and are flexible enough to find a time that works for both of us.

## Using the library

#### Reserving a room

Off-site research sessions ideally take place in a reserved room of the public library. Some planning needs to go into reserving a conference room or shared learning room.

All neighborhood libraries have conference rooms available for use. [Follow the library's steps](https://library.austintexas.gov/meeting-rooms) to reserve one of those conference rooms. Some librarians are really flexible and helpful. If a room is not available online, don't hesitate to

The [Central Library](https://goo.gl/maps/XmaQ6wvu8x6RGFn67) has a lot of shared learning rooms available to use. [Follow these steps](https://library.austintexas.gov/central/shared-learning-rooms) to reserve one of those rooms.

{% hint style="info" %}
Rooms need to be reserved at least 3 days in advance, but should be reserved as soon as you have a meeting time and location nailed down to guarantee you have a private, comfortable space for the participant
{% endhint %}

#### Impromptu library research

We love libraries because they are super supportive of our work. We have done some impromptu usability testing in the neighborhood libraries, but that recruitment is really opportunistic.

As an attempt to leverage the libraries we researched out to librarians and asked them what their busiest hours are and what events they host. This data can be used to help strategize the best time and location to do this type of research. Check out the details they gave us [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UEmU\_guk1gGqGc8vTHQxs3kiRMDz8pdvJffKAxFImT0/edit?usp=sharing)!

#### Setting up a table at the library

Coordinate with the Library Communications manager or individual library branch managers to set up at table at library branches or library events.

## Research in the field

(Document about why and how we do user research in the field)

## At Faulk

Scheduling research at Faulk is easiest for us. When this is the case, we should consider the participants' experience when coming into our space.

#### Parking & Getting in the Building

Work with Gerald and/or security to cone off a parking spot in the parking lot for your participant. Be sure to let your participants know that the parking space with the cone in it is for them. Most participants are not confident moving the cone and taking the parking space. So, make it a practice to meet your participants in the parking lot and escort them in the building through the side door.

After parking, you can escort them into the building through the side door and take them to the security desk to sign in and get a badge.
