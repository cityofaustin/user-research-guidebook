# Recruitment & Screening Document

## Why do you need a recruitment & screening document.

It is important to talk to the right people when doing user research. If you wanted to know what it was like to swim at Barton Springs, would you ask someone who had never been there? Absolutely not! You would ask someone who had recently gone since they are the best source of information on the subject. When conducting user research it is important to identify who can give answers to your questions.

Well planned research requires clearly identified participants and timelines. Outlining these details will help you, or anyone involved in recruitment and coordination know who you need to talk to and when you will need to talk to them.

## **What details should you include in your recruitment & screening document.**

### **Goal**

In a couple of sentences state why you are doing this research and what you hope to get out of it.

### **Research Questions**

#### List the specific questions you are interested in.

These questions should In this section you should list the questions you are looking to get insight into through user research. These aren't interview questions, but rather the reasons you are doing user research.When determining these questions it is important to involve all project participants. I like to make this a discussion early in the research planning phase.

A great list of research questions are specific, not overly general and focus on new information to learn about the users.

Here is an example of some of the research questions we identified before conducting usability testing on a new content type.

1. Can people tell where to start looking for the answer in the new interface?
2. Do users understand how staring works? Is it useful? What is their impression?
3. How would users interact with checkmarks? Are they checkmarks helpful?

### **Deadline**

Identify the date that you would like user research to be completed.

### Research Methodology

Are you doing user observations, conducting user interviews or perhaps doing usability testing? The methodology you choose should be determined by your research goals and questions.

### Total number of Participants

How many people do you need to run this study with? This will depend on your methodology and resources.

### Identifying the Right Participant

Like the Barton Springs example, it is important to define and select participants that will give you the right insight to your questions. Answering the questions bellow will help develop a screener or filter out individuals in the recruitment database.

| Who do you want to talk to?      | What exact criteria will identify the people you want to talk to? | What screening questions should we ask? (Questions shouldn't reveal the right answers)                                         |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| People who have used thermostats | Have a thermostat at home                                         | What brand thermostat(s) do you have in your home? (Answers include list of brands and “I don’t have a thermostat in my home”) |
