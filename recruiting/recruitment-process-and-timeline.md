# Recruitment & Screening Document

## Recruitment & Screening Document Overview

It is important to talk to the right people when doing user research. Well planned research requires clearly identified participants and timelines. Outlining these details helps you and others involved in recruitment or coordination determine who to talk to and when you will need to talk to them.

## **Details to Include in the Recruitment & Screening Document**

### **Goal**

Include a short summary of why you are doing the research and what you hope to gain from the research.

### **Research Questions**

#### List the specific questions for the information you want to capture.

The questions should be thought provoking to gain knowledge for all project participants. Do not frame the questions as interview questions. Frame the questions in a way the includes the reasons for the user research. These question types invoke discussion early in the research planning phase.

A great list of research questions are specific, not overly general and focus on new information to learn about the users.

Here is an example of some of the research questions we identified before conducting usability testing on a new content type.

1. Can people tell where to start looking for the answer in the new interface?
2. Do users understand how staring works? Is it useful? What is their impression?
3. How would users interact with checkmarks? Are they checkmarks helpful?

### **Deadline**

Identify the date that you would like user research to be completed.

### Research Methodology

The methodology you choose should be determined by your research goals and questions.

Are you performing user observations?

Conducting user interviews or perhaps doing usability testing?

### Total number of Participants

The number of participants included in the study depends on your methodology and resources.

### Identify the Right Participants

It is important to define and select participants that will give you the right insight to your questions. Answering the questions below will help develop a screener or filter out individuals in the recruitment database.

| Who do you want to talk to?      | What exact criteria will identify the people you want to talk to? | What screening questions should we ask? (Questions shouldn't reveal the right answers)                                         |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| People who have used thermostats | Have a thermostat at home                                         | What brand thermostat(s) do you have in your home? (Answers include list of brands and “I don’t have a thermostat in my home”) |
