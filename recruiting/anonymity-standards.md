# Anonymity Standards

We are committed to minimizing the risk of harm to residents while collecting and documenting information. Our priority is to be good stewards of the information we collect. We have established the following anonymity practices so that a project cannot link individual responses with participant identities.

## When we ask for demographic information

There are some circumstances where we ask for a participant demographic information when doing research. We always take the time to consider why we are asking for demographic data. We do not collect the data if it is not required.

We have determined that we only ask for demographic detail under two circumstances.

1.  **When the demographics are relevant to a participant story.**

    Example:
2.  **When there is a issue of equity in the service being offered.**

    Example: When conducting research about Community Gardens we wanted to understand the different needs of senior citizens when they interacted in the physical space of the garden. This required us to collect research participants ages when we interviewed residents.

#### These optional demographics can include:

* Gender
* Ethnicity
* Age
* Income
* Zip code

## Transcribing and Documenting Research sessions

We assign each participant a unique number when we document any type of research. This is simply a project name abbreviation followed by a number.

For example: the first research participant for a project called The Guide would be coded as TG1.

#### Here is an example of how that would look in a rainbow sheet for a usability test.

## Collecting Photos and Videos

Collecting photos and videos is an important part of the work we do. Photos taken during user research is accomplished with the following standards:

* Participants are asked for consent before _**any**_ photo is taken.
* Photos do not include any part of the participants face and do not reveal any unique identifiers about the participant.
* Photos are used outside of the project sparingly and with good judgement
