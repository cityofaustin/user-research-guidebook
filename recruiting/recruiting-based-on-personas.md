# Recruiting based on personas

We also developed some resident personas that we may want to conduct specific research around in the future. For that reason we also ask residents if any of the follow statements describe them:

* I am a senior
* I have a disability
* I am new to Austin
* I am looking for a job
* I am starting a business
* I am a veteran
* I am a college student
* English is my second language
* I identify as LGBTQ+
* I am pregnant or have kids under the age of 18
* I consider myself low income
* I am a refugee
* I am an immigrant
* I am a teenager
* I work with or mentor teenagers
* I am a pet owner
* I use assistive technology, such as a screen reader, magnification application, or text-to-speech synthesizer
