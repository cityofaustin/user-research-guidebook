# Research & Recruitment Guiding Principles

This can be as easy or as complicated as you need it to be.&#x20;

Some test methods do not involve any recruitment work prior to the test. But sometimes you’ll want to find people who closely resemble the type of people who will actually be using your product, in which case you’ll need to do some recruitment work.

## Residents First

The City of Austin believes residents come first. This means that we connect with the community early and often in our design process. We do this to understand community needs and expectations and to test and refine solutions.

## Diversity and Inclusion in Research

We also believe hat research should be conducted with a diverse set of participants. We work hard to understand who our residents are and include a broad spectrum of those residents in our research. We realize that this is a work in progress and that we will likely never be perfect it, but we do not allow that challenge to prevent us from doing our best.

#### **Appropriate inclusion**

We practice appropriate inclusion ensuring the effected part of the Austin population in our process working on projects. We understand that we should not design for residents, but rather _with_ them.

#### **Inappropriate exclusion**

We also never exclude specific people from participating in research that otherwise meet the research criteria. We do our best to make it easy for residents to participate and make it a point to work with them to overcome barriers that would prevent them from participating in research with us.

## Principles of Ethics in Research

Aligning with the principles of ethics in research is essential in our research process. These principles are:

* Obtain [informed consent](../consent-guide/participant-consent.md)
* Minimize the risk of harm to participants
* Protect their [anonymity](../research-ethics-and-etiquette-draft/anonymity-standards.md) and confidentiality
* Avoid using deceptive practices
* Enable participants to withdraw from research
