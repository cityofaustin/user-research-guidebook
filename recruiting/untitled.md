# Research & Recruitment Guiding Principles

## Residents First

At the City of Austin, we believe that residents come first. This means that we connect with the community early and often in our design process. We do this to understand their needs and expectations as well as to test and refine solutions.

## Diversity and Inclusion in Research

We also believe that research should be conducted with a diverse set of participants. We work hard to understand who our residents are and include a broad spectrum of those residents in our research. We realize that this is a work in progress and that we will likely never be perfect at it, but we don't allow that challenge to prevent us from doing our best.

#### **Appropriate inclusion**

When working on projects that effect a specific part of Austin's population we practice appropriate inclusion, by making sure that we include them in our process. We understand that we shouldn't design for residents, but rather _with_ them.

#### **Inappropriate exclusion**

We also never exclude specific people from participating in research that otherwise meet the research criteria. We do our best to make it easy for residents to participate and make it a point to work with them to overcome any barriers that would prevent them from participating in research with us.

## Principles of Ethics in Research

Aligning with the principles of ethics in research is essential in our research process. These principles are:

* obtain [informed consent](../research-planning-draft/compensation-guidelines/participant-consent.md)
* minimize the risk of harm to participants
* protect their [anonymity](anonymity-standards.md) and confidentiality
* avoid using deceptive practices
* give participants the right to withdrawal from research
