# Recruitment Strategy

We conduct research on a variety project types using different research methods. Our recruitment strategy varies depending on the project.

Our goal is to get access to people that have gone through or have appropriate insight into the experience for which we are looking to understand. Sometimes that experience is very specific and other times it is not. For this reason, there is not a one-size-fits-all approach to research participant recruitment.

### General Recruitment

We are continually building up a database of potential research participants who are eager to share their experiences. We created a screener survey in English and Spanish as a way to easily recruit and organize participants.

We promote that screener through various social media channels, medium posts, and at community events. We are currently in the process of developing a more robust participant engagement plan and will document what works well.

We use this database of participants when we are testing tools or solutions that are intended to serve the Austin residents as a whole. There are times we need to understand more about our potential participants experiences and backgrounds before we can determine if they are a good match for a particular research session. We send out a short question screener to the whole database when we need this understanding.

### Targeted Recruitment

Often we are looking for participants who have had very specific experiences. As an example: we recently did usability testing for a new content type for complex non-linear processes. We populated our prototype with the instructions to get a Food Truck Permit this is the case. We needed individuals who had gone through the Food Truck Permitting process to participate in a usability test because the content in the prototype was specific.

We sent out targeted emails to Food Truck owners to recruit those individuals.

### Vulnerable Populations Participant Recruiting (DRAFT)

### Community Involvement

We engage with diverse types of community groups knowing that they are key to engaging with a variety of Austin residents. This process can include inviting them to our offices and talking to them about what we are doing and how we approach our work. These visits enable allow us to get their understanding and trust in what we are doing. Attending community group meetings and events is a way to get connected to a variety of residents.

We also work hand in hand with communications and public engagement office at the City of Austin. We rely on them for social media campaigns and involving a diverse group of residents in research.

### **Participants Referral Requests**

We always make it a point to ask for referrals from residents who have participated in research with us. Asking for referrals is especially effective when we need to do research with specific types of people.

Recently the City of Austin needed to interview foster parents. Once we were able to get an interview with one foster parent, we asked them for a referral. We got this email in response:

> Hi Alex,
>
> We have a Facebook group for families using the same agency my wife and I use. Would it be alright if I posted your information there so they can reach out to you directly; or would you prefer do get their contact information and reach out like you did with me?
>
> If it's alright to post the info, what information would you prefer to be posted? Just your email addresses or also include phone numbers?
>
> Thanks, Jennifer Smith

We send over copy groups can clearly and easily communicate what we are looking for when groups are willing to post to social media or listservs. We sent the following:

> Hi Jennifer,
>
> Thanks for coming in for the interview today and for being willing to help us get more foster families involved in our research. Posting my information would be great! I prepped a short message for you so that you can just copy and paste it if you like.
>
> "This morning I participated in a design research session with the City of Austin about the foster home inspection process. They are conducting research as an effort to improve the process. The session was an interview that took about 45 minutes and I received a **$40 gift card from HEB** for my time. They are looking for a few more foster families who have been through the inspection process to interview.
>
> If you are interested you can email, text or call Kristin Taylor: Kristin.Taylor@austintexas.gov 512-888-8888
>
> Thanks again!
>
> Kristin Taylor

We were able to quickly schedule interviews with qualified participants aftee Jennifer made this referral. Without her referral, we would have likely had to delay the project.
