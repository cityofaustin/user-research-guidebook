# General Recruitment Screener

Our general recruitment screener is [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScEZa1kZM6Agyibq5L3y9JnFsV6hfNOaaSu8hq9FAPUnlmwqQ/viewform?usp=sf\_link). We also have a [spanish translation](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfjG1wxPhaj2tD-2mBk\_8UKDMQ4MUW7VPjzLzQQEDC6SpNY7w/viewform?usp=sf\_link) of the form available.

In our screener we ask residents for the follow details:

* Name (first and last)
* Email address
* Phone number
* Languages spoken
* Zip code
* How long they have lived in Austin
* Age
* Gender

Of all of those details, only first name and email address are required.

We also developed some resident personas that we may want to conduct specific research around in the future. For that reason we also ask residents if any of the follow statements describe them:

* I am a senior
* I have a disability
* I am new to Austin
* I am looking for a job
* I am starting a business
* I am a veteran
* I am a college student
* English is my second language
* I identify as LGBTQ+
* I am pregnant or have kids under the age of 18
* I consider myself low income
* I am a refugee
* I am an immigrant
* I am a teenager
* I work with or mentor teenagers
* I am a pet owner
* I use assistive technology, such as a screen reader, magnification application, or text-to-speech synthesizer
