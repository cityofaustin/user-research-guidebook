# Incentives Guidelines

### I**ncentives are Important**

It is crucial to provide incentives to compensate participants for their time to ensure inclusive and equitable research. Some people might have to take time off work or go out of their way to test your prototype. We are excluding a portion of our population that will provide valuable data without the incentives. Providing an incentive is also helpful if you are asking for a large effort from them for your test or if you have follow-up test sessions.

### **Recommended Incentive Bands (Draft - waiting on approval from CMO)**

We pay community members based on how much of their time we use. The compensation amount reflects our estimate of the value of the information the City receives for a given amount of time. We tie the value of one hour to the greater of the City of Austinâ€™s living wage or the current national estimated value of a volunteer hour.

We can additionally compensate for logistical costs to participate such as transportation to a scheduled in-person event, time off from work, child care, and food. Depending on the project or initiative, we may even compensate for the emotional costs to participate (e.g. evoking feelings of anger, shame, or anxiety).&#x20;

The compensation amount reflects our estimate of the value of the information the City receives; for example, a $30 gift card may be provided for a one-hour interview. You can calculate minimum compensation using this simple formula: Duration (minutes) / 2 = Amount. Below are minimum compensation amounts depending on how much time you plan to use:

| Duration  | Amount  |
| --------- | ------- |
| 20 min    | $10     |
| 40 min    | $20     |
| 1 hour \* | $30     |
| 90 min    | $45     |

### Incentive **Guidelines (Draft)**

The City's Innovation Office is currently working on an Administrative Bulletin to outline the guidelines. Once complete we will provide a link to the Bulletin.&#x20;
