# Compensation Guidelines (DRAFT)

### I**ncentives are Important**

It is crucial to provide and incentive and compensate test participants for their time to help ensure inclusive and equitable research. Some people may have to take time off work, or may test a prototype out of curiosity. We are excluding a portion of our population that may provide valuable data without incentives. An incentive is a necessary action to thank participants for time and effort. The incentives ensures a broad pool of participants. Providing an incentive is also helpful when asking for a large effort of them for your test or if you have follow-up test sessions.

\*\*\* Not recommended

### **Compensation Guidelines**

* Gift cards are not allowed to be general / same as cash and must be for specific businesses, such as: HEB/coffee shop/amazon/bus passes/other transport
* Research/Usability test plan must be created and include defined demographic targets and plans for reaching the desired participants.
  * Equitable and inclusive research plans are required prior to release of funds
  * Gift cards should be provided at the time of interview to avoid problems with coordinating delivery and ensuring participants feel valued
  * See the Gift Card procurement Process&#x20;
* Request approval for budget usage from Gerald Oliver who coordinates with Marni Wilhite
* Consider the most beneficial environment for the research
  * Does it need to be contextual (actions they mostly take at home or at work) or can it be in a public library or other setting that meets them where they are?
  * Scheduling in home, in their office, or other contextual space should provide higher compensation levels due to the fact that they will be preparing for us. Itâ€™s not just during the time of the interview that they will be using their time.
  * Scheduling where they would have to travel to us should also compensates at a higher rate due to travel time for the participant.
