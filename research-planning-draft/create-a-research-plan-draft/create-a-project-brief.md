# Create a Project Brief

## Project Title&#x20;

Date: `xxxxx, xxth, xxxx`&#x20;

Version: `review`&#x20;

Prepared by: `________` &#x20;

## The Problem&#x20;

### Background

`Setting the stage for the project (may include any previous project/research that led to this project, related projects, etc. This is the section where you can describe what causes the problem, how often it occurs, where and when it occurs, and who the problem impacts.`

### Problem statement

`A problem statement is a clear and concise description of the problem or issue a team aims to address in a project. It identifies a problem’s current state, desired future state, and the gaps that lie between the two.`

`It doesn't define the solution to the problem or provide a road map for solving the problem; it only gives an outline of what the problem is.`

`However, the team can later use the problem statement to validate that their work delivered an outcome that resulted in the solution.`

### Assumptions

`They’re called assumptions because you assume that for your project to move forward successfully as planned, these things will be in place. Even though you don’t have proof at the moment, you expect them to occur during the project. But just because you assume them to be true doesn’t mean that everyone else does. That’s why it’s important to go through the process of identifying your project assumptions.`\


### Business needs and goals&#x20;

`business needs and goals are gaps between the current state of a business and its goals. Needs are the basic drivers of change in an organization that are identified as requirments.`&#x20;

## The Audience

`Your target audience is the reason you’re working on this project. No matter what type of project you’re working on, it’s important to include your target audience in your project brief so everyone on your team is on the same page about who the audience is.`&#x20;

### Definition of Success&#x20;

`Project success can be defined as the achievement of something desired, planned or attempted`
