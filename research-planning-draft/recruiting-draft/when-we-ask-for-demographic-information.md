# When we ask for demographic information

There are some circumstances where we ask for a participant demographic information when doing research. We always take the time to consider why we are asking for demographic data. We do not collect the data if it is not required.

We have determined that we only ask for demographic detail under two circumstances.

1.  **When the demographics are relevant to a participant story.**

    Example: When determinating  whether the individuals in a particular study are a representative sample of the target population for generalization purposes.\

2.  **When there is a issue of equity in the service being offered.**

    Example: When conducting research about Community Gardens we wanted to understand the different needs of senior citizens when they interacted in the physical space of the garden. This required us to collect research participants ages when we interviewed residents.

#### These optional demographics can include:

* Gender
* Ethnicity
* Age
* Income
* Zip code
