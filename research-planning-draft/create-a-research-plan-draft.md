# project brief

A project brief states directly what goals or expectations should prevail as the main mandate for the work. The brief summarizes the plan for the project: what you’re doing, why you’re doing it, relevant constraints that will drive your work, and what out-comes you expect. &#x20;

****\
**Use When**&#x20;

* You’re starting a new project &#x20;
* You’ve inherited an in-progress project or have joined a team that’s already been working together, but you need to get clarity and alignment on what you’re ultimately expected to deliver&#x20;

\
**Average time**&#x20;

* 2-3 hours total &#x20;
* 1 hour to write the brief &#x20;
* 1-2 hours to share with people (either in one-on-one conversations or a group meeting)&#x20;
