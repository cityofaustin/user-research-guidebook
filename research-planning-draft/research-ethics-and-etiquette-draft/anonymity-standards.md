# Anonymity Standards

We are committed to minimizing the risk of harm to residents while collecting and documenting information. Our priority is to be good stewards of the information we collect. We have established the following anonymity practices so that a project cannot link individual responses with participant identities.

## Transcribing and Documenting Research sessions

We assign each participant a unique number when we document any type of research. This is simply a project name abbreviation followed by a number.

For example: the first research participant for a project called The Guide would be coded as TG1.

#### Here is an example of how that would look in a rainbow sheet for a usability test.

## Collecting Photos and Videos

Collecting photos and videos is an important part of the work we do. Photos taken during user research is accomplished with the following standards:

* Participants are asked for consent before _**any**_ photo is taken.
* Photos do not include any part of the participants face and do not reveal any unique identifiers about the participant.
* Photos are used outside of the project sparingly and with good judgement
