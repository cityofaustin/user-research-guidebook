# Research Ethics and Etiquette

## Keep an Open Mind

* Come in with fresh eyes: Treat every test as a brand new learning opportunity Even if you have been working in this field or have worked on this idea for a long time.&#x20;
* Do not bring personal biases: Leave your assumptions and biases behind so you have an unfiltered mind learn new information instead of automatically rejecting the information.

## Designate Roles Before&#x20;

## Be Curious and Listen to Participants

* Awkward silences are ok: Most participants need time to process and think before answering.&#x20;
* Avoid interrupting or finishing participants sentences: Do not assume you know what the participant is going to say.
* Do not contradict or correct them even if the participant is wrong: We are there to learn about how they experience your prototype.&#x20;
* Ask open ended questions: Do not ask leading questions that may sway their answer or make them feel like they have to validate your prototype or opinion.&#x20;
* You might have the urge to over explain your concept, teach them how to use it, or try to convince them that your concept is valuable. That will not lead to accurate test results. Refrain from leading participants or swaying participant perspectives. Only provide enough context so participants know what they are looking at and step back to see how they interact with your idea.&#x20;
* Ask follow-up questions or ask participants to elaborate.

## Always Document

* Take notes verbatim, as much direct quotes as possible. We will synthesize later
* Take as many photos/audio/video as you can.  Ensure you ask for permission in the beginning.
