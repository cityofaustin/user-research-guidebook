# User Centered Testing, why do it?

User centered testing is the practice of showing your idea to the people who will be using your idea to incorporate their feedback early and frequently. Since you are testing with users every step of the way, you’ll avoid situations where you build something for a few years behind closed doors only to find that it doesn’t work for your users after you launch it! Testing saves you money, time, effort, and reduces risk.
