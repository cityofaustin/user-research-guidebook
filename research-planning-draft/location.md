  We engage with the community near where they live and work at a time that
  works with their schedule to make it possible for all residents to participate
  in research.

# Location

Conducting user research in our office at times that are convenient to us is always easier on our end. Not all residents would be involved in research if we limited it to our office and during regular working hours. We always offer to meet them where they are and are flexible in finding a time that works for all of us when scheduling research session with residents.

## Using the Library

#### Reserving a Room

Off-site research sessions ideally take place in a reserved room of the public library. Some planning is needed to reserve a conference room or shared learning room.

All neighborhood libraries have conference rooms available for use. [Follow the library's steps](https://library.austintexas.gov/meeting-rooms) to reserve one of the conference rooms. Some librarians are very flexible and helpful.

The [Central Library](https://goo.gl/maps/XmaQ6wvu8x6RGFn67) has many shared learning rooms available to use. [Follow these steps](https://library.austintexas.gov/central/shared-learning-rooms) to reserve one of those rooms.

{% hint style="info" %}
Rooms need to be reserved at least 3 days in advance, but should be reserved as soon as you have a meeting time and location established to guarantee you have a private space for the participant
{% endhint %}

#### Impromptu Library Research

We use libraries because they are supportive of our work. We have performed impromptu usability testing in the neighborhood libraries, but that recruitment is really opportunistic.

We reached out to librarians and asked them what their busiest hours are and what events they host in an attempt to leverage the libraries. This data can be used to help strategize the best time and location to do this type of research. Check out the details they gave us [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UEmU\_guk1gGqGc8vTHQxs3kiRMDz8pdvJffKAxFImT0/edit?usp=sharing)!

#### Setting up a table at the library

Coordinate with the Library Communications Manager or individual Library Branch Managers to set up at table at library branches or library events.
